I am applying for the Senior Software Engineer – Cyber Security / Certificate Lifecycle Management position at \company. I bring extensive experience in secure software development, backend systems, and cryptography, with hands-on work in PKCS\#11 modules, certificate management, and post-quantum cryptography. I have developed backend solutions using Rust, Python, and C, managed SQL databases, and deployed applications in Linux environments, always following secure coding practices and conducting thorough testing. My experience includes coordinating development tasks in Agile/Scrum teams, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and delivering maintainable, high-quality software. I hold a Master’s degree in Information Security from Tampere University and have applied my expertise in both research and professional projects to build secure systems. I am confident that I can contribute immediately to the development and maintenance of the Certificate Lifecycle Manager product and provide secure, robust solutions. I am available to provide further technical documentation or code samples if needed.
